# Lab 4: Final Project

---

## Introduction

In this lab we were to choose a project to do that utilizes an arduino, sensors, and at least another piece of hardware (mine included servos, LEDs, a speaker, and also an MP3 module). I chose to attempt recreate the turret gun from Portal 2, from this source: https://www.instructables.com/Portal-2-Turret-Gun/

It was a learning experience, however it may have been too ambitious of a project for someone who has never messed with wiring or soldering before.

## First Steps

The first steps taken for this project were downloading and printing the 3D files for each part. This included the main shell, the wings, the legs, and all the internal parts that were supposed to make it swivel and open its arms.

## Soldering to PCB

Next we began to solder each component to a PCB.
