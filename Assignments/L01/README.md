# Lab 1: LED Fundamentals

---

## Introduction

In this lab, we learned about the basics of LEDs and how to connect them up to an Arduino utilizing a breadboard.
The materials we used included an arduino board, a breadboard, jumper wires, LEDs (single color and RGB), a potentiometer, and resistors.
The end goal of the lab was to make the LEDs blink in various ways utilizing code sent to the Arduino.
The blinking rate could then later be controlled by the potentiometer.

## Part 1: Powering one LED

Just like it says, this is about gettong one LED powered via the Arduino. To achieve this, one LED was connected to the breadboard. One one rail was the positive side, and on the other rail was the negative side.
In this lab, I connected the resistor to the rail that had the negative side. Upon researching more, I found out that in most cases it does not matter which rail the resistor is connected to. After connecting the resistor, one jumper cable goes from the positive side to a numbered connector on the Arduino (for power from the board and control via code) and another jumper cable goes from the negative side to the ground connector on the Arduino.

I forgot to take a picture of what part 1 looked like, so for now here is the diagram of what it is supposed to look like.

## Notes

Just use `---` to create horizontal lines between sections.  
You can use `**bold**` or `_italic_` to emphasize text if needed.
